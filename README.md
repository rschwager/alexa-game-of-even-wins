Alexa Skill implementing the game of Even Wins
=========================

This project implements an Amazon Alexa skill that plays the game of even wins.  The game of evens wins was originally put out in 1975 by Digital in BASIC.  Here is the [Source Code](http://www.atariarchives.org/basicgames/showpage.php?page=62).  The game is adapted from that original source code and tailored to the Alexa Skill toolkit and experience.

The skill is being hosted on gomix [here](https://dark-distance.gomix.me/alexa/even_wins_game).  That url provides a debug interface to use the game without having an alexa device. The skill is using the npm module of [alexa-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/alexa-app) rather than using the sample code put out by Amazon.
